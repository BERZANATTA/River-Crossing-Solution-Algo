    "_Note. This is basically the same as Project 09, but with a more clear \"ending\" and grading rubric. Little else about the statement has changed. Review the text below and see if you need to modify your solution. If you already have everything done, great! You don't need to make work for yourself if you've met the requirements with your Project 09 code._\n",

    "In this classic problem, a wolf, goat, and cabbage must be moved from one side of the river to the other. The farmer has a boat for the purpose, but the boat is small and will only hold the farmer and one of the three items at a time. The goat and cabbage can't be left alone \\(the goat will eat the cabbage\\) and the wolf and goat can't be left alone \\(the wolf will eat the goat\\). You'll use the idea of state machines to recursively find a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest you encode the states of the problem with 4\\-tuples. In class I think we used $(w, g, c, b)$ so that the first value of the tuple encodes the wolf's location \\(left or right\\), the next encodes the goat, and so on. You may want to change this encoding. In class I used $-1$ to denote left bank and $+1$ to denote right bank. You can change this as well. It would probably be good to have some named constants like `LEFT = -1` and `RIGHT = 1` to make your code more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transitions between states also have to be encoded. Transitions are actions we can take. I used `(w, b)` in class to denote the transition \"the wolf and boat change sides\". This is actually two different transitions since they might move from left to right or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some transitions will always be nonsensical, e.g., \"move the wolf and cabbage from left to right\" \\(the boat has to move\\). Some are okay from certain problem states, but inadmissible from others. For example, \"move X and Y from right to left\" is inadmissible from the start state, since everything starts out on the left. Eventually your program will need to decide, based on the current problem state, which transitions are nonsense and also which ones lead to a losing state \\(either the goat or the cabbage is consumed\\). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the function `do_instruction` that moves our abstract state machine from one state to the next. It takes one parameter for the current state and one parameter for the instruction. I chose an encoding for the transitions that is described in the docstring below. You can modify this function to use different encodings if you like. The advantage of mine is that we can simply use addition to compute the new state. But, I haven't solved this completely yet. There may be disadvantages that will only become apparent later.\n",
